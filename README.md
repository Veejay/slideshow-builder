# Slideshow Builder
A Slideshow Builder built on Angular 2

The application will be built using:
- Visual Code Studio (which provides nice TypeScript integration)
- Twitter Bootstrap 4 (which should make up for my disastrous CSS skills)
- TypeScript because it's the modern way to build web applications with Angular

## TODO

- Create all the components
- Handle file picker / drop events
- Provide a preview for the selected slide
- Provide pagination
- Let user define transitions
