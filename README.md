# Slideshow Builder
A Slideshow Builder built on `AngularJS 2` (see https://angular.io/)

The application will be built using:
- `Visual Code Studio` (which provides nice `TypeScript` integration)
- `Twitter Bootstrap 4` (which should make up for my disastrous `CSS` skills)
- `TypeScript` because it's the modern way to build web applications with `AngularJS`

## TODO

- Create all the components
    - Main view
    - Thumbnails for the selected slides
    - Preview pane for the currently selected slide
    - Sidepane for the all the actions (might be contextual to either the slide list or the current slide)
- Handle file picker / drop events
- Provide a preview for the selected slide
- Provide pagination
- Let user define transitions
